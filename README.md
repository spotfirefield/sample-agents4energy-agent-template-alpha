# Building AI Agents with LangGraph and AWS Amplify

This workshop teaches you how to build, deploy, and manage AI agents using LangGraph and AWS Amplify. You'll learn how to persist agent state, create custom tools, build interactive UIs, and deploy agents to AWS Lambda.

## Launch the Interactive Environment

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amplify-langgraph-template
cd amplify-langgraph-template
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd workshop
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The interactive environment includes:
- TypeScript/JavaScript support
- AWS Amplify CLI pre-installed
- LangGraph dependencies configured
- Live preview of UI components
- Integrated terminal
- Real-time collaboration support
